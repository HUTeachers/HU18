## Work To Do.
Room to Room management. (Minimap ?)
Elevators
Wall running?

Sprites for everything:
 - Player
 - Frignis (Weapon)
 - Walls
  - Activatable walls
 - Switches
 - Enemies


## Considerations
Should bullets collide? If not, change them, custom layer management perhaps.

Whats our art style here? if metroid, then should we just rip it off completely?
Look into importing that nice retro sprite renderer for sprites.
